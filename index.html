<p> My cause is to understand how living things work. This is important to me because living organisms comprise the most complicated and
fascinating systems in the known universe. The human body undergoes billions of biochemical reactions every day. Even the seemingly-simple
actions of blinking or raising a finger involve thousands upon thousands of moving parts at the molecular level coordinating in highly-intricate
patterns. Many of these reactions are a complete mystery to us today. In addition to being inherently beautiful, studying living systems can
also reveal profoundly powerful technologies. Personally, I believe death is the greatest tragedy of the human experience. Studying biology
allows us to understand why and how our bodies break down, enabling us to develop means to combat lethal diseases.</p>
<p> The first dataset is of immense historical value to biology. It summarizes the results of Gregor Mendel's famous pea plant experiments,
where he observed the inheritance of certain traits in pea plants. Gregor Mendel noticed that certain traits were inherited by offspring
in predictable proportions, and from these observations derived laws of inheritance which account for them. He concluded that some traits
were dominant over others, and that many traits were inherited independently of each other. He made his discoveries at about the same
time Charles Darwin published his ideas on natural selection, which really form the basis for modern biology. However, Charles Darwin failed
to understand exactly how inheritance worked. He could explain the net result of inheritance over millions of years, but his ideas about
the mechanisms of inheritance were deeply flawed. Gregor Mendel filled in the gap left by Darwin, which eventually supported the modern 
chromosomal theory of inheritance. His work with pea plants would eventually help explain DNA's role as the fundamental unit of inheritance.

<p> The second dataset was collected more recently. It lists the number of deaths in each US State attributed to one of the top ten leading
causes of death. This dataset ties in more to the ultimate purpose of my cause. Most of these causes of death could potentially be mitigated
or eliminated through biological research - heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, strokes, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes,
influenza, and kidney disease. If we mastered the fundamentals of biology, these diseases could disappear entirely. So I hope to spend my life
contributing to humanity's efforts to understand living systems, so that someday the numbers in that dataset drop to zero.</p>
